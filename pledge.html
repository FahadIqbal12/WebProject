            <h2>I am a Karenite and I behold this spirit forever.</h2>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Life is a gift and I am grateful to God for bestowing it on me. Everyone is born with a purpose and I will strive hard to become what I was meant to be.</li>
                <li>I will always stand by the motto of the School "LABOUR REAPS REWARD" . With tirelessefforts, self-belief and confidence, I will indeed ‘SHINE TO OUTSHINE'.</li>
                <li>Indiais my country and being born as an Indian is a privilege. A nation's pride is immersed in the VALUES THAT ARE VALUED FOREVER. Therefore, I will ensure to maintain dignity, respect, love, the spirit of sacrifice, tolerance and compassion amongst fellow brethren irrespective of caste, creed, race, religion and gender.</li>
                <li>Being an active and responsible citizen of the country , I will respect differences and learn to appreciate the social cultural, regional and linguistic plurality of our country echoing ‘Unity in Diversity' which holds so true.</li>
                <li>I will train myself for a worthy life . Our actions are governed by our thoughts. I will train my mind to think positively and from different perspectives. I will think BEYOND and realise the privilege bestowed on me to be an agent of love, kindness and help. I will extend my helping hand to the underprivileged and the aged. I will forever be mindful of the service to humanity and help the marginalized to join the mainstream by motivating them to have faith in their innate strengths.</li>

                <li>A healthy mind dwells in a healthy body. I will not only focus on my academics but also on sports, exercise and other co-curricular activities. With practice, perseverance and patience, I will overcome obstacles that come in the way of my personality development.</li>
                <li>Education is a powerful tool which starts with building self-esteem in oneself and aims at social commitment to uplift the society . May God give me the courage and wisdom to spread awareness and educate children who are the future.</li>
                <li>I will aspire to reach the sky through my work and dedication but never forget my roots, from where I started and be humble in my words and actions. I will give my best to accomplish my goals that will contribute in making a peaceful world.</li>
